 * ESP-IDF builds C++ in a newer GNU dialect by default (gnu++23 or gnu++26), which would accept a
 * C++23 feature or a GNU extension in a header. main/CMakeLists.txt compiles this file alone with
 * -std=c++20 -pedantic-errors and the ESP-IDF toolchain of the target, and the assertion below
 * proves the flag took effect (handbook KB-CPP20-001, check strict-dialect). It adds no code.
