# MISRA C++:2023 review

The handbook's compliance matrix is the reference, not the standard itself. The matrix gives each guideline's
number, MISRA's category, the category we enforce, a one-line summary in our own words and how it is verified.
The standard's text is copyrighted: never quote it, paraphrase it beyond the matrix summary, paste it into code,
commits, pull requests or comments, or upload or attach the licensed copy. Cite guidelines by number
(`Rule 7.0.5`, `Dir 0.3.1`).

1. **Use the pinned handbook.** The commit the repository follows is the `ref:` of the handbook checkout in
   `.github/workflows/ci-repo-checks.yml`. Fetch the matrix and the project-wide deviations at that commit:
   `curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kokeb-labs/handbook/<ref>/compliance/misra-cpp-2023.yml` and the
   same for `compliance/misra-cpp-2023-deviations.yml`. Read the repository's level in `.kokeb/handbook.yml`.
2. **Find the scope.** `git diff --name-only origin/main...HEAD -- inc src tests examples` and, for each changed
   file, the changed lines (`git diff -U0`). Review only what changed, plus any code the change makes reachable.
3. **Map each changed construct to guidelines.** For each one (a cast, a shift, a loop, a switch, a lambda, a
   template, a buffer access, an initialisation, a header), find the guidelines whose matrix `summary` covers it.
   Then follow each entry's `verification`:
   - a tool entry without `partial: true` decides the guideline: confirm the CI job that runs it passed (or run
     the tool locally) instead of judging it yourself;
   - a `partial` tool entry finds some violations only: run it, then also do the entry's `review` step;
   - a `review` entry: check the changed code against its `how` text and say what you checked;
   - `not-applicable`: confirm the construct the reason rules out really is absent (for example, no `throw`).
   Apply the entry's `our_category`, never a weaker one.
4. **C++20 constructs** are reviewed through deviation MD-CPP-001 and the handbook's C++20 profile: a feature the
   profile allows is checked against its KB-CPP20 guidelines and the profile page's mapping table (a concept as a
   template, span indexing as array access, and so on). A forbidden feature, a deprecated one or anything from
   C++23 or later is a violation of Rule 4.1.1 with no deviation. Run the `cpp20-profile` skill for these.
5. **Licensed text and private notes, only if you hold them.** If you hold a licensed copy of MISRA C++:2023
   and the maintainers' private interpretation notes, use them to decide how a guideline applies; otherwise work
   from the handbook's compliance matrix: guideline numbers and its summaries only. Never quote the standard or
   the notes in this repository, a pull request or a review comment.
6. **Deviations follow the handbook's model.** A project-wide deviation (`MD-CPP-NNN`) covers a finding only
   inside its `scope`. A finding in one place that is correct and deliberate gets a suppression that names the
   check and the reason on the line (`// NOLINTNEXTLINE(<check>): <reason>`), and at the high and safety levels an
   entry in `docs/deviations.yml` (`id`, `rule`, `check`, `where`, `reason`, `risk`, `approved_by`, `date`). A
   mandatory guideline is never deviated. Do not add a deviation or a waiver yourself: propose it in the report
   for the maintainer to approve, and fix the code when a fix exists.
7. **Check the patterns the code already follows**, which the `MISRA` CI job (`.github/workflows/ci-misra.yml`)
   holds it to; new code uses them too:
   - every switch over a scoped enumeration, or one with a fixed underlying type, lists its cases and ends with
     `default: break;` as its last label, followed by the existing fallback (`return "Unknown";`); the tests
     build with `-Wswitch-enum`, so a new enumerator still warns (Rule 9.4.2);
   - every `if ... else if` chain ends with an `else`, with a comment when it does nothing (Rule 9.4.1);
   - an operand of a binary or ternary operator that is itself a binary expression of higher precedence is
     parenthesised: `(a == b) && (c < d)`, `(x < y) ? x : y` (Rule 8.0.1);
   - a narrow operand meets a `U` constant (`count == 0U`), and a bit operation on two narrow operands widens one
     to `uint32_t` first (Rule 7.0.5);
   - an integer constant argument has its parameter's type: `DelayUs(port, 1000_u32)`, `Insert(0_u8, v)` with the
     `consteval` literals of `inc/xmpl100_detail.hpp` (Rule 7.0.6). Remember that `uint32_t` is `unsigned long`
     on Cortex-M, so even `0xFFU` is the wrong type for a `uint32_t` parameter there. Bring a literal in with
     `using detail::operator""_u32;` at the top of the function that uses it, or write the code inside
     `namespace detail`; a namespace-scope using-declaration of a literal operator makes lizard read the rest of
     the file as one function and fail the complexity gate;
   - a loop bound that is not a constant is a `const` local before the loop (Rule 9.5.1);
   - a result that is not used comes from a call that returns `void` (`std::fill`, not `std::fill_n` or
     `std::ranges::fill`) (Rule 0.1.2);
   - a declaration and its definition use the same parameter names (Rule 13.3.3);
   - a defaulted `operator==` is a hidden friend (Rule 16.6.1);
   - the `#include "../src/xmpl100.ipp"` at the end of `inc/xmpl100.hpp` is deviated by MD-CPP-009, named on the
     line before it: `// codeql::misra_deviation_next_line(MD-CPP-009)` (Rule 19.0.3).
   - an enumeration has only real values: no `kCount`/`kLast` sentinel. The range a raw value is checked against
     is the `detail::EnumLast<E>` specialisation next to the enumeration, used by `detail::IsEnumerator()` and
     its compile-fail test; a sentinel would be a value no switch can handle and `-Wswitch-enum` would demand it
     in every switch (Rule 9.4.2);
   - a member template called on a local of a class-template member is written `x.template first<2>()`: the
     CodeQL front end otherwise reads `first < 2` and stops extracting the function, which fails the scan's
     extraction check.
8. **Read the CI report the `MISRA` job attaches** (`misra-report`: `misra-summary.md`, `misra-findings.csv`).
   - *Violations* fail the job at the high level for a required or mandatory guideline; fix them.
   - *To review* are findings of a rule the ci-tools tool validation found reporting compliant code; the
     `review` column names the anomaly ids (ci-tools `tests/misra-validation/anomalies.yml`). Check each one: a
     real one is fixed, a false one needs nothing more. In class-template code the known misfires are member calls
     reported as function-pointer conversions (Rule 7.11.3), `Result` or dependent conditions reported as
     conversions to bool (7.0.2), writes to data members as dead writes (0.1.1), same-type comparisons as
     signedness changes (7.0.5), braced casts `T{x}` as C-style casts (8.2.2), and `noexcept` functions as
     throwing ones under `-fno-exceptions` (18.4.1). Never contort code to silence one.
   - A tool misfire in a shape the suite does not record yet is reported to ci-tools with a minimal reproducer,
     so the suite gains a case and the anomaly log an entry.
9. **Report** in the pull request (or to whoever asked), ranked by our category, mandatory first:

   | Guideline | Our category | File:line | Finding | Fix, or deviation to propose |
   | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |

   Then two lists: the guidelines decided by a tool in CI for this change (with the job), and those you reviewed
   by hand (with the review step). Say which tools you could not run locally. At the safety level, add that the
   commercial checker's run in CI is the final word for every guideline no open tool decides.
