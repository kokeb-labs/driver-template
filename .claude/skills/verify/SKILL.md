# Verify

Run from the repository root. Tool configuration is in `_config/`: pass its path, never copy it to the root.
Stop at the first failure, fix the cause, start again. Never weaken a check to pass.

1. Configure and build the host tests, doc snippets, compile-fail tests and the strict-dialect header checks:
   `cmake -S . -B build -DXMPL100_BUILD_TESTS=ON -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug && cmake --build build --parallel`.
   Every target builds as ISO C++20 (`CMAKE_CXX_EXTENSIONS OFF`, `-pedantic-errors`), and the target
   `xmpl100_header_checks` compiles each public header alone and asserts the dialect (handbook KB-CPP20-001).
2. Run them: `ctest --test-dir build --output-on-failure`. This includes the version-copy tests, the install
   consumer, the host example (`examples/host`) and, when `doxygen` is installed, Doxygen with warnings as errors.
3. If both GCC and Clang are installed, repeat 1 and 2 with `-DCMAKE_CXX_COMPILER=g++` and `clang++` in separate
   build directories.
4. The handbook's source checks (include guards, bus requirements, raw access, the C++20 profile), at the commit
   CI pins (the `ref:` of the handbook checkout in `.github/workflows/ci-repo-checks.yml`):
   `curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kokeb-labs/handbook/<ref>/checks/source_checks.py -o /tmp/sc.py`
   and `python3 /tmp/sc.py scan --repo .`. Every finding fails CI.
   Then the stand-alone check: `python3 tools/check_standalone.py`. It reports another project's name (a board,
   a test project, another driver repository), a dated history line, and a copyright holder other than
   `The <repo> authors`. Rewrite the sentence as this chip's behaviour with its datasheet section; a step still
   to check on hardware stays a bench procedure without a date.
5. Format the changed C++ files: `clang-format --style=file:_config/.clang-format -i <files>`, then
   `git diff --exit-code` shows nothing new.
6. Tidy the changed files in `inc/` and `src/` when clang-tidy is installed:
   `cmake -S . -B build -DCMAKE_EXPORT_COMPILE_COMMANDS=ON` then
   `clang-tidy -p build --config-file=_config/.clang-tidy <files>` on the changed `.cpp` files and the tests
   that include the changed headers; fix findings in changed lines.
7. cppcheck and complexity, as CI runs them (when installed):
   `cppcheck --std=c++20 --language=c++ --enable=warning,style,performance,portability,information --force
   --inline-suppr -I inc inc src` reports nothing, and `lizard -l cpp -m -w inc src` stays within the limits of the
   repository's level (handbook ADR-0020).
8. Markdown:
   `npx markdownlint-cli2 --config _config/.markdownlint.json "**/*.md" "#build*" "#examples/esp32/scripts"`
   (skip if Node is not available and say so in the PR).
9. Docs (in a venv with the docs theme, see AGENTS.md):
   `kokeb-docs figures && kokeb-docs gen`, then
   `kokeb-docs check && mkdocs build -f _config/mkdocs.yml --strict -d /tmp/site`.
   Commit any figure or generated region that changed. CI builds the docs without submodules; if
   `examples/esp32/scripts` is checked out, run `git submodule deinit -f examples/esp32/scripts` first (its
   README has figure markers of its own), and `git submodule update --init` afterwards.
10. In the template repository only: `python3 tools/scaffold.py --selftest` scaffolds every kind into temporary
   directories, checks that each scaffolded root holds only the allowed files, no template name, no other
   project's name and the portable copyright (the stand-alone check with `--strict`), and runs steps 1, 2 and 9
   on each.
11. Review the change: the `cpp20-profile`, `misra-review` and (drivers) `hardware-lessons-review` skills, or the
    `safety-reviewer` agent (`.claude/agents/safety-reviewer.md`), which runs them with `datasheet-conformance`
    and reports without editing. Fix what they find, or list it in the PR with the reason.
12. Delete the build directories (`build*/`, `/tmp/site`) when done.

Report what ran and what could not run locally (ESP32 builds always run in CI only).
