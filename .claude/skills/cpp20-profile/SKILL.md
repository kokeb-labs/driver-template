description: Check C++ code against the handbook's C++20 profile (guidelines KB-CPP20-001 to 058) - which features to use, use with rules or never use - running the automated checks first and reviewing the rest. Use when writing or reviewing any C++ in inc/, src/, tests/ or examples/.

# C++20 profile check

The handbook's C++20 profile (Standards > C++20 profile, rules `KB-CPP20-*`) says which C++20 features the code
may use, the rules each comes with, and which it may not use. Deviation MD-CPP-001 covers exactly the allowed
set: anything else, anything C++20 deprecates and anything from C++23 or later is a defect, even when a compiler
accepts it.

## 1. Run what is automated

1. The strict-dialect build: configure and build the host tests (`cmake -S . -B build -DXMPL100_BUILD_TESTS=ON`,
   `cmake --build build`). Every target builds as ISO C++20 with `-pedantic-errors` and the C++20 deprecation
   warnings as errors, and the target `xmpl100_header_checks` compiles each public header alone, asserting that
   the dialect is C++20. Repeat with the other host compiler if you have it. The Cortex-M and ESP-IDF builds of
   the same checks run in CI (`ci-cross-build.yml`, and the ESP-IDF example's
   `xmpl100_cxx20_check.cpp` when the repository has one).
2. The handbook's source checks at the pinned commit (the `ref:` in `.github/workflows/ci-repo-checks.yml`):
   `curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kokeb-labs/handbook/<ref>/checks/source_checks.py -o /tmp/sc.py`
   then `python3 /tmp/sc.py scan --repo .`. The `cpp20-profile/...` findings are forbidden features,
   `CMAKE_CXX_EXTENSIONS OFF` missing, an `Error` or `Result` type without `[[nodiscard]]`, a requires-expression
   inside `if constexpr`, and a header that includes the Kconfig header.
3. clang-tidy with `_config/.clang-tidy` on the changed files (see the `verify` skill); the profile relies on
   `bugprone-dangling-handle`, `bugprone-unchecked-optional-access`, `hicpp-signed-bitwise`,
   `cppcoreguidelines-misleading-capture-default-by-value` and `modernize-use-designated-initializers`.

A finding is fixed in the code. Never switch a check off or add a suppression to pass it.

## 2. Review the rest

For each changed construct, decide its verdict:

- **Use** (no extra rules): `enum class` with a fixed `uint8_t`-style base, `[[nodiscard]]`, `constexpr`,
  `static_assert`, `std::array`, `if`/`switch` with an initialiser, nested namespaces, standard concepts,
  fixed-extent `std::span`, `<bit>`, `std::in_range` and `std::cmp_*`, `[[maybe_unused]]`, defaulted special
  members, default member initialisers, range-`for` over named arrays and spans, digit separators.
- **Use with rules**: concepts (exact hook signatures, `detail::ExactHook`, `noexcept`), optional-hook detection
  (named `Has<Hook>` and `Declares<Hook>` concepts), `if constexpr` (each branch instantiated by a test),
  dynamic `std::span` (size checked before the first access, never stored), designated initialisers (every member
  defaulted), defaulted `operator==` (integral members only, as a hidden friend:
  `friend constexpr bool operator==(const T& lhs, const T& rhs) noexcept = default;`), lambdas (explicit
  captures, never stored), CRTP (port-independent code outside the class template), `consteval` (build-time
  construction, run-time `Validate()` kept; the `_u8`/`_u16`/`_u32` literals of `detail`), `constinit`,
  `std::bit_cast` (never for byte order), `using enum` (block scope), `std::optional` (never `.value()`),
  structured bindings (error tested first), the `std::ranges` algorithms (no views).
- **Forbid**: coroutines, modules, range views and `<ranges>`, `<format>` and `std::print`, `<=>` in drivers,
  `char8_t`, parenthesised aggregate initialisation, lambdas in unevaluated operands, generic lambdas in drivers,
  `[[fallthrough]]`, `[[no_unique_address]]` in drivers, `[[likely]]` without a measurement,
  `std::is_constant_evaluated`, `constexpr` allocation, `std::variant`/`any`/`function`/`expected` in drivers,
  feature-test macros, every C++23 feature (`std::to_underlying`: use `detail::ToUnderlying`).

Then go through the guidelines the change touches. The integer ones find the most defects: a shift count that is
not masked or checked in the same function (020), a `uint8_t` or `uint16_t` operand not widened to `uint32_t`
before a bit operation (021), a narrowing compound assignment (022), an integer cast to an enumeration without a
range check (025), a loop bound from configuration that is not validated against a named maximum (058), a
pointer and a length instead of a span (042).

| KB-CPP20-002 Only profile features; nothing from C++23 or later | required | source check `cpp20-profile/forbidden-features`; `strict-dialect`; `include-allowlist/driver`; `include-allowlist/target`; review: A C++20 feature not in the profile joins it and MD-CPP-001 in one pull request, or is not used. |
| KB-CPP20-003 Nothing C++20 deprecates | required | compiler `-Wdeprecated`; compiler `-Wdeprecated-enum-enum-conversion`; compiler `-Wdeprecated-enum-float-conversion`; clang-tidy `cppcoreguidelines-misleading-capture-default-by-value` |

| KB-CPP20-005 Every template parameter is constrained by a named concept | required | review (CodeQL query planned); review: Every new template parameter names its concept. |
| KB-CPP20-006 Port concepts check the exact hook signature and `noexcept` | required | `compile-fail-tests`; review (CodeQL query planned); review: Each port concept matches every hook with `detail::ExactHook` and states `noexcept` on it. |
| KB-CPP20-007 Optional hooks use named detection concepts; a misdeclared hook is an error | required | source check `cpp20-profile/inline-requires`; `compile-fail-tests` |
| KB-CPP20-008 One dependent-false helper | advisory | review: Discarded branches use `detail::kAlwaysFalse`. |
| KB-CPP20-009 Code that does not depend on the port lives outside the class template | advisory | review (CodeQL query planned); review: A static member that never names the port moves out. |
| KB-CPP20-010 Abbreviated function templates are constrained and stay out of the public API | advisory | review (CodeQL query planned); review: No `auto` parameter in public driver API. |
| KB-CPP20-011 Concepts carry meaning; overloads are not chosen by subsumption | advisory | review: No two overloads differ only in one being more constrained. |

## 3. Report

List each finding as `KB-CPP20-NNN`, category, `file:line`, what is wrong and the compliant form, mandatory and
required first. Say which automated checks ran and which only run in CI. A feature the profile does not list is
not used until the profile and MD-CPP-001 are changed in the handbook first.
