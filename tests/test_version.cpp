 * @brief The version getters follow the generated xmpl100_version.h, so they cannot drift from
 * CMake.
 *
 * Built twice by tests/CMakeLists.txt: against the real generated header (the getters must equal
 * the CMake project version, passed as EXPECTED_*), and against a probe header generated from the
 * same template with version 9.8.7 (a getter that returns a literal instead of reading the header
 * fails there).
